# 3d-printing
usefull files for 3D printing such as TronXY X1 [Marlin](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin) config
using the [GT2560 controller board.](http://www.geeetech.com/wiki/index.php/GT2560)
The board is reasonably cheap and reliable. Biggest advantage is the stepper motor connectors fit in te sockets on the board. No soldering or crimping connectors. Endstops unfortunately not. You will also need servo drivers such as A4988 or TMC2100
